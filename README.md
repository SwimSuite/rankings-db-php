# Rankings DB

Rankings DB is a PHP library to provide a clean interface to interact with the British Swimming rankings database.


## Install
Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require huwcbjones/rankings-db *
```

## Basic Usage
```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \RankingsDB\RankingsClient($personal_key, $personal_key_id_number);
```

From a `$client` object, you can fetch member details and times.

```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \RankingsDB\RankingsClient($personal_key, $personal_key_id_number);

// Get a member's details
$member = $client->getMemberDetails($member_id);

// Get their all time PBs
$options = new GetTimesBuilder($member->MemberID());
$times = $client->getTimes($options);

// Get their times from the past year
$options->setFromDate((new DateTime())->sub(new DateInterval("P1Y")));

$times = $client->getTimes($options);
```
